ODBTP Version 1.1.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------

ODBTP (Open Database Transport Protocol) is intended for use as
an interface to Win32 based ODBC drivers from a non-Win32 based
application.  It consists of a Win32 service and a client
library for building applications that can communicate with the service
via TCP/IP.  The package also includes a PHP extension that was built
using the client library.

The ODBTP client/server package requires the installation of a Win32
service, and a C client library. While the service can only be installed
on a Win32 host, the client library can be installed on both non-Win32
and Win32 hosts.

* To install Win32 service, read the ./winservice/README file.
* To build ODBTP client library, read the file INSTALL,
* View README.64bitOS when building ODBTP client library on a 64-bit OS.
* To install PHP extension, read the ./php/README file.
