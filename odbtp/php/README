Installation of ODBTP PHP Extension
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Static Version:

1. Make a directory called "odbtp" under the <php dist dir>/ext
   directory.

2. Copy all files from <odbtp dist dir>/php/ext/odbtp to
   <php dist dir>/ext/odbtp.

3. "cd" to <php dist dir> and run ./buildconf.

4. Run ./configure and include the --with-odbtp option along
   with any other desired configure options.

5. Make and install PHP.


Shared Version:

1. Change to the directory <odbtp dist dir>/php/ext.

2. Open the file Makefile with a plain text editor, such as vi, and
   change the value of PHP_INCROOT, if necessary.

3. Run "make".

4. Copy the file php_odbtp.so to a location where it can be loaded in
   a PHP script with the dl() function.


Example PHP scripts that can be used for testing are contained in
<odbtp dist dir>/php/examples. The file odbtptest.sql can be used
to build the table and stored procedures used by the init.php,
list.php and rollback.php scripts.
